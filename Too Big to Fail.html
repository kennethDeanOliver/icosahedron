        <p class="lead">A jumbotron, sometimes referred to as jumbovision, is a video display using large-screen television technology (video wall).</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>The original technology was developed in the early 1980s by Mitsubishi Electric and Sony, which coined JumboTron as a brand name in 1985. Mitsubishi Electric sold their version of the technology as Diamond Vision. It is typically used in sports stadiums and concert venues to show close up shots of an event or even other sporting events occurring simultaneously, as well as outdoor public places (such as Times Square, for example).</p>

    <h1>Now, for a couple of random scraps of text I've gathered from my collection...</h1>
    <p>"For as long as humanity existed, it has lived in fear of things unknown. We called them gods, demons, monsters, and we prayed that no harm shall come unto us, that there will come heroes who would defend us from them. Eventually, we grew wiser and sealed these horrors away to the best of our abilities, purging them from our consciousness. However, this is no more than a temporary solution; we have not truly defeated the unknown, we merely forgot its existence, and this ignorance shall be our downfall, for we will not know what to do once the seals are broken and the unknown comes forth." — Prof. Carlyle "Carl" Edwards, Flaws of the Masquerade</p>
    <p>Once upon a time, an entity known as the All-Creator manifested the multiverse out of nothing, teeming with life. To help maintain His Creation, He created angels, beings of stasis, and demons, beings of change, before creating all sorts of life. However, with the help of His demons, Creation would rebel against the All-Creator, and He would be slain, His many Parts scattered throughout the multiverse. The mortals who happened upon these Parts would become the archons, inheritors of the All-Creator's ability to create something out of nothing, though bound by the limits of their mind.

        In the modern day, a piglin named Everett, formerly the royal advisor, had the ruler he once served, King Percival, deposed and thrown into prison, while he takes the crown. Now, with the Piglin Kingdom under his rule, he executes a grand ritual with his peculiar staff, housing the legendary Orb of Dominance, throwing much of Creation into his home universe, the Three Realms, hoping to find the Demiurge, the greatest Part of them all.
        
        Within the chaos of the Three Realms, a girl named Chloe Cerise happened upon one of the many Parts, making her the Yellow Lord. Together with a monster hunter named Dustin and a dragon named Flurr, the Fogbound Trio would challenge King Everett's mastery over the multiverse, encountering many allies, enemies, and other enigmatic characters along the way.</p>
